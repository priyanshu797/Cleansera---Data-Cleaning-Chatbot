Data Cleaning Chatbot
Project Overview

Data Cleaning Chatbot is an intelligent, Flask-based web application designed to automate and simplify the process of cleaning and preprocessing datasets.
It acts as an AI-powered data assistant, allowing users to upload raw CSV files, explore dataset columns, clean data interactively, and download the refined version — all through an intuitive chat-style interface.

This project brings together data engineering, AI, and UI automation principles to streamline tedious data preparation workflows in a user-friendly manner.

✨ Features

File Upload Support – Upload raw CSV datasets directly from your computer.

Data Column Overview – Automatically lists column names and basic info.

Data Cleaning Options – Detect and handle missing values, duplicates, or invalid data.

Undo Action – Revert the most recent cleaning step.

Download Cleaned File – Export cleaned datasets as CSV files.

AI Chat Interface – Interact with the assistant to request cleaning tasks.

Gemini AI Integration – Backend logic powered by Gemini for contextual data understanding.

Smart Logging – Track every cleaning action for transparency.

Responsive UI – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no React) for fast and lightweight interaction.
