🧹 Data Cleaning Chatbot
🧭 Project Overview

Data Cleaning Chatbot is an intelligent, Flask-based web application designed to automate and simplify the process of cleaning and preprocessing datasets.
It acts as an AI-powered data assistant, allowing users to upload raw CSV files, explore dataset columns, clean data interactively, and download the refined version — all through an intuitive chat-style interface.

This project brings together data engineering, AI, and UI automation principles to streamline tedious data preparation workflows in a user-friendly manner.
